Byrne's research examines the conditions under which communication messages with strategic intent are ineffective\, met with resistance or even result in the opposite of the intended effect. She focuses primarily\, but not exclusively\, on youth and adolescent populations.\n\n\n\nImagine a media health campaign featuring a beautiful high school girl speaking about the negative consequences of her former addiction to heroin. No matter how strong her arguments about the consequences of her addiction\, some members of the audience will be distracted by her beauty and thinness\, which they may find attractive\, and desire to be like her no matter what she argues about ill effects. If her attractiveness is selected as the processing priority\, attention to this element will lead to unintended effects.

DESCRIPTION:The Visual Arts Center\, in collaboration with the art publication Pastelegram\, presents the fall 2012 edition of "Two Ships Passing" on the topic of sound art with invitee Barbara Perea\, a Mexico City-based curator\, critic and lecturer with a concentration in emerging media\, sound and video art.\n\n\n\nStraddling the worlds of contemporary visual art and music\, sound art includes diverse practices\, from inventive machines\, video and film\, to performance and other possibilities. Sound art's boundaries are thus amorphous\, posing particular complexities to those who wish to display such works or write about the field. These issues form the basis from which Barbara Perea\, this edition's invitee\, begins her conversation.

His most notable effort was his Futurama display at the 1939-1940 New York World's Fair\, which adopted the motto "I Have Seen the Future."

DESCRIPTION:Albert Beveridge III gives a talk titled "Scriptor Renatus: Anthony Trollope." Why do some artists who are at the very top of their craft both in critical acclaim and popularity fall from their pinnacles - only to be restored in subsequent years? Writer Anthony Trollope is a case in point.\n\n\n\nTrollope made slow progress during the course of his early career in the post office (but can claim credit for the familiar pillar-box for letters)\, and was unsuccessful in politics. It took over 20 years for him to establish his tradition of the novel-sequence in England\, including\, in the end\, 47 novels. After his peak as a writer in the 1860s\, his popularity began to decline\, only to be substantially revived in the latter part of the twentieth century to the present.

DESCRIPTION:Naghmeh Sohrabi\, Brandeis University\, presents a lecture titled "Shah-Rah or the King's Road: Reinterpreting the European Travel Writings of Nasir al-Din Shah Qajar." Nasir al-Din Shah (r. 1848-1896)\, was the longest reigning Qajar monarch. He documented his travel to Europe extensively.\n\n\n\nUntil recently\, these travelogues were dismissed by scholars for focusing on frivolous and repetitive information. This talk presents a new interpretation of Nasir al-Din Shah's extensive travel writing by placing them in their own cultural and political milieu\, and by focusing on the question of why the king would choose to so meticulously record his travels.\n\n\n\nSohrabi is the Charles (Corky) Goodman Professor of Middle East History and the associate director for research at the Crown Center for Middle East Studies at Brandeis. Her book "Taken for Wonder: Nineteenth Century Travel Accounts from Iran to Europe" was recently published by Oxford University Press. Her new research focuses on the assassination of Nasir al-Din Shah in 1896 by a follower of Jamal al-Din al-Afghani. In addition to her scholarship on the nineteenth century\, Professor Sohrabi writes and lectures on contemporary politics and culture of Iran.

DESCRIPTION:The Broccoli Project presents Don Nigro's "Paganini\," a dark comedy in two acts about the infamous virtuoso violinist Nicolo Paganini\, whose skill with the violin was so great that many believed he was a marionette of the devil. Contact director David Skaggs at skeegz@gmail.com with questions.\n\n\n\nUsing Paganini's 24 Caprices for Violin as a haunting soundtrack\, the play traces the grotesque and satirical adventures of Paganini as he plays throughout Europe\, his century's equivalent of a rock star.

His most notable effort was his Futurama display at the 1939-1940 New York World's Fair\, which adopted the motto "I Have Seen the Future."

DESCRIPTION:I Film del Circolo concludes its fall screenings with Rocco Papaleo's "Basilicata Coast to Coast" (2010)\, a musical road movie filmed against the backdrop of some of southern Italy's most beautiful countryside. In Italian with ITALIAN subtitles.\n\n\n\nWhen accepted into a music festival\, Nicola and his band decide that a 10-day cross-country journey on foot will act as a publicity-seeking\, chemistry-building exercise from which the band can only emerge better off. Predictably\, the end of the characters' odd journey from one sea to another turns out to be not as important as the journey itself\, through which they will evolve and learn much about themselves and the meaning of their lives.

Many elements of this question have not been adequately addressed.  Nor has responsibility for the rupture between academic and popular history been fairly apportioned.  What is the situation\, and what can be done to address shortcomings on both sides?  \n\n\n\nJames M. Banner\, Jr.\, is a historian of the United States and the discipline of history.  Formerly a member of the Princeton faculty\, he is the author of books and articles on history\, teaching\, and public affairs\, most recently Being a Historian: An Introduction to the Professional World of History (Cambridge).

DESCRIPTION:Is Christianity the source of important truths\, moral law and man's rights\, and thus profoundly good for mankind? Or is it antithetical to all such values and thus profoundly bad? For the first time ever\, a top Objectivist intellectual - atheist Andrew Bernstein - debates a top Christian conservative\, Dinesh D'Souza. Unlike others who have debated D'Souza\, Bernstein will offer a rational alternative to religion in this debate.

DESCRIPTION:The Department of Anthropology and the Humanities Institute present a talk by Lauren Berlant titled "The Commons: Affect and Infrastructure." Berlant is George M. Pullman professor of English\, University of Chicago.\n\n\n\nThere's a romantic story about the common\, a pastoral story of nature and human creativity\; and an antipastoral one of rage\, exploitation\, theft\, loss\, mourning and radical resistance. At the same time there is ambivalence toward  being in common\, as properties of relationality and relations of property and intimacy encounter each other frictionally. This segment of a longer work focuses on Waldo Emerson\, Juliana Spahr and Liza Johnson's attempts to risk making and inhabiting the unbearable commons\, addressing the sacrifices a nonuniversalist common might entail\, including the priority of the human (the persistence of the inhuman\, the aspiration to the impersonal\, the recognition of activity in all things)\, on the other side of which is an optimism about aesthetics and\, in particular\, an ethics and politics of analogy.

DESCRIPTION:Author Morris Dickstein presents the lecture "America's Best Magazine?: Commentary in the 1960s." The Commentary archive resides at the Ransom Center and includes correspondence with Norman Mailer\, Bernard Malamud\, James Baldwin and Elie Wiesel.\n\n\n\nFounded in 1945 as a monthly journal of general interest from within the Jewish community\, Commentary went through a dramatic shift in 1960 under its new editor\, Norman Podhoretz\, who applied more rigorous critical standards and made greater use of strong-minded New York intellectuals such as Irving Howe\, Alfred Kazin and Mailer. The magazine responded to all the major controversies of the decade\, from the Eichmann trial and the civil rights movement to the Vietnam War and the Columbia student uprising. \n\n\n\nDickstein is Distinguished Professor of English and Theatre at the CUNY Graduate Center. \n\n\n\nView a live webcast of this program at www.hrc.utexas.edu/webcast.\n\n\n\nThe Albert and Ethel Herzstein Charitable Foundation made a generous donation to support this program and the cataloging of the Commentary magazine archive.

DESCRIPTION:The Visual Arts Center\, in collaboration with the art publication "Pastelegram\," presents the spring 2013 edition of Two Ships Passing focused on the topic of pacing and featuring invitee Kyle Schlesinger and his guest\, Austin writer Cindy St. John. Two Ships Passing explores pertinent topics within the creative community through conversation.\n\n\n\nCentral to magazine work - online or in print - is the consideration of the pacing of images\, texts and ideas. Structuring how information unfolds over time concerns many of those working in temporal media such as magazines\, films or written narratives.\n\n\n\nIn each edition of this conversation series\, one speaker is invited and prompted to request the company of a committed colleague\, mentor or perhaps even a new acquaintance\, creating a unique pairing for a dialogue. This remarkable event aims to establish a reactive space where ideas will be exchanged and unexpected conclusions reached.

Read sample sage advice from Dr. Toughlove here: http://www.readthehorn.com/users/dr_toughlove. Free food served.\n\n\n\nMany have compared Dr. Toughlove to an ice pick. He's cold\, tough and pointed. Pulling from years of escapades\, rejection and his own brutal honesty\, Dr. Toughlove engages relational problems as few do. He advocates for relationships based on honesty and consent. He refuses to add even the thinnest of sugar coatings to his responses. In other words\, he levels with his readers in way they may find comfortable or uncomfortable\, but always darkly funny.

Embracing blackness\, which is often seen as the desirable and logical tactic to counter racism\, is an insufficient response.

DESCRIPTION:A panel discussion explores a pivotal period in Texas politics in which a group of lawmakers\, known as the Dirty Thirty\, challenged the influence of special interests in the Legislature and the power of the House leadership.\n\n\n\nIn 1971\, the Dirty Thirty called for an investigation of then Speaker of the House Gus Mutscher and other state officials named in a federal bribery-conspiracy case. This small band of reformers turned the federal case into a political issue\, sparked a movement for more transparency in the activities of the Legislature and inspired Frances "Sissy" Farenthold's run for governor in 1972. More than 40 years later\, the experiences of the Dirty Thirty still offer a lesson in the challenges of creating and sustaining political reform.

Refreshments provided.\n\n\n\nIt is well known that U.S. president Franklin Roosevelt envisioned a postwar order based on four great powers\, the so-called "four policemen": the United States\, the Soviet Union\, Great Britain and China. But why did Roosevelt insist on including China among the four policemen when China had long been considered a minor power and when his other wartime allies\, Churchill and Stalin\, both strongly opposed the idea? This talk explores this question and shows how it shed light on U.S. global strategy in the 1940s and since.

Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS)\, Johns Hopkins University. Refreshments provided.\n\n\n\nWhy do Americans wage war the way they do? Some point to the Civil War and World War II as the seminal events in our military history\; others see the frontier contest between Native Americans and settlers as the crucible of the American approach to war.  Professor Cohen offers another interpretation: that it emerged over a protracted struggle\, both conventional and irregular\, with the European masters of Canada\, over a period of nearly two centuries\, and that its focal point was the Great Warpath route between Albany and Montreal.\n\n\n\nCohen is the Robert E. Osgood Professor of Strategic Studies at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) of the Johns Hopkins University and founding director of the Philip Merrill Center for Strategic Studies.

DESCRIPTION:The Edward A. Clark Center for Australian & New Zealand Studies launches its Fulbright Distinguished Speakers Series with a talk by Malcolm Feeley\, whose research compares the Australian and American experiences with privatization of prisons. Australia leads the world in the proportion on inmates held in private prisons.\n\n\n\nFeeley is the Claire Sanders Clements Dean's Chair Professor of Law at Berkeley Law School. Feeley's spent six months in Australia in 2012 as Fulbright Flinders University Distinguished Chair in American Political Science. Whereas privatization is taken for granted by both conservatives and liberals in Australia\, in the U.S.\, it remains a highly controversial project. Feeley examines differences in public reactions to prison privatization\, differences in the quality of services and programming in public versus private prisons and differences in the ways in which corrections officials approach privatization in the two countries.

In recent times polyhedral shapes have been identified at the microscopic level in crystalline shells such as fullerenes\, viral capsids and protein-based bacterial organelles. The most frequently found polyhedron in homogeneous crystalline shells is the icosahedron. Olvera de la Cruz and colleagues demonstrate that other geometries arise spontaneously in shells formed by more than one component.

His research focuses on the molecular biology of sensory transduction and neurotransmitter action in the mammalian nervous system. His goal is to understand the molecular basis of somatosensation - the process whereby we experience touch and temperature - with an emphasis on identifying molecules that detect noxious (pain-producing) stimuli. He is also interested in understanding how somatosensation is altered in response to tissue or nerve injury.\n\n\n\nThe Lorene Morrow Kelley Lectureship was established with gifts by Lorene Kelley Morrow to honor her sister\, Marie Betzner Morrow\, who at the time of her death in 1971 was an associate professor of microbiology at The University of Texas at Austin.

Read the material here: https://mises.org/journals/jls/9_1/9_1_2.pdf.\n\n\n\nAre roads\, education\, security or other such goods public goods? Are governments necessary to provide these goods? Or can the market not only provide them but provide them more efficiently and effectively?\n\n\n\nHoppe argues that public goods do not exist\, and that the government has no business being involved in the production of any goods\, even those seemingly "public."

DESCRIPTION:Is our economy on the verge of hyperinflation? Join the Mises Circle to discuss Thorsten Polleit's "Hyperinflation\, Money Demand\, and the Crack-up Boom" for a look at how money can be destroyed overnight. Find the article here: http://mises.org/daily/4016.\n\n\n\nMises and Rothbard saw that government-controlled fiat money can endure inflation without destroying the money. That is\, unless people believe the central bank will expand the money supply at ever-greater rates. At this point\, the crack-up boom will unfold\, and the fiat money is doomed to be worthless scraps.
