Imagine a media health campaign featuring a beautiful high school girl speaking about the negative consequences of her former addiction to heroin. No matter how strong her arguments about the consequences of her addiction, some members of the audience will be distracted by her beauty and thinness, which they may find attractive, and desire to be like her no matter what she argues about ill effects.

Why do some artists who are at the very top of their craft both in critical acclaim and popularity fall from their pinnacles - only to be restored in subsequent years? Writer Anthony Trollope is a case in point.



Trollope made slow progress during the course of his early career in the post office (but can claim credit for the familiar pillar-box for letters), and was unsuccessful in politics. It took over 20 years for him to establish his tradition of the novel-sequence in England, including, in the end, 47 novels. After his peak as a writer in the 1860s, his popularity began to decline, only to be substantially revived in the latter part of the twentieth century to the present.","Harry Ransom Center (HRC), Tom Lea Rooms 3.206","2012-10-05 14:45:00-05:00","2012-10-05 16:30:00-05:00","http://www.utexas.edu/cola/progs/britishstudies/"

"Travel writings of Nasir al-Din Shah Qajar are talk topic","21569@utexas.edu","Naghmeh Sohrabi, Brandeis University, presents a lecture titled ""Shah-Rah or the King's Road: Reinterpreting the European Travel Writings of Nasir al-Din Shah Qajar."" Nasir al-Din Shah (r. 1848-1896), was the longest reigning Qajar monarch. He documented his travel to Europe extensively.



Until recently, these travelogues were dismissed by scholars for focusing on frivolous and repetitive information. This talk presents a new interpretation of Nasir al-Din Shah's extensive travel writing by placing them in their own cultural and political milieu, and by focusing on the question of why the king would choose to so meticulously record his travels.



Sohrabi is the Charles (Corky) Goodman Professor of Middle East History and the associate director for research at the Crown Center for Middle East Studies at Brandeis. Her book ""Taken for Wonder: Nineteenth Century Travel Accounts from Iran to Europe"" was recently published by Oxford University Press. Her new research focuses on the assassination of Nasir al-Din Shah in 1896 by a follower of Jamal al-Din al-Afghani. In addition to her scholarship on the nineteenth century, Professor Sohrabi writes and lectures on contemporary politics and culture of Iran.","Student Activity Center (SAC) 2.120","2012-10-08 15:00:00-05:00","2012-10-08 16:30:00-05:00","http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/mes/events/23801"

"Ransom Center offers free tours of Arnold Newman exhibit","23850@utexas.edu","The Harry Ransom Center offers free, docent-led tours of the exhibition ""Arnold Newman: Masterclass"" every Tuesday. The exhibition explores the career of photographer Arnold Newman (1918-2006), who created iconic portraits of some of the most influential innovators, celebrities and cultural figures of the twentieth century. All docent tours begin with a brief introduction to the Ransom Center and the Gutenberg Bible.



A bold modernist with a superb sense of compositional geometry, Newman is known for a crisp, spare style that situates his subjects in their personal surroundings rather than in a photographer's studio. Marlene Dietrich, Harry Truman, John F. Kennedy, Arthur Miller, Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso are only a few of his celebrated sitters. Newman's archive resides at the Ransom Center. Featuring more than 200 of these well-known masterworks, the exhibit also includes rarely seen work prints and contact sheets.

In 1971, the Dirty Thirty called for an investigation of then Speaker of the House Gus Mutscher and other state officials named in a federal bribery-conspiracy case. This small band of reformers turned the federal case into a political issue, sparked a movement for more transparency in the activities of the Legislature and inspired Frances ""Sissy"" Farenthold's run for governor in 1972. More than 40 years later, the experiences of the Dirty Thirty still offer a lesson in the challenges of creating and sustaining political reform.","School of Law (CCJ), Eidman Courtroom 2.306","2013-03-28 17:30:00-05:00","2013-03-28 19:30:00-05:00","http://www.utexas.edu/law/centers/humanrights/events/"

There's a romantic story about the common, a pastoral story of nature and human creativity; and an antipastoral one of rage, exploitation, theft, loss, mourning and radical resistance. At the same time there is ambivalence toward  being in common, as properties of relationality and relations of property and intimacy encounter each other frictionally. This segment of a longer work focuses on Waldo Emerson, Juliana Spahr and Liza Johnson's attempts to risk making and inhabiting the unbearable commons, addressing the sacrifices a nonuniversalist common might entail, including the priority of the human (the persistence of the inhuman, the aspiration to the impersonal, the recognition of activity in all things), on the other side of which is an optimism about aesthetics and, in particular, an ethics and politics of analogy.","Student Activity Center (SAC) 5.118","2013-04-01 12:00:00-05:00","2013-04-01 13:15:00-05:00",""

Platonic and Archimedean solids have beguiled scientists, artists and mathematicians for millennia.

The Commentary archive resides at the Ransom Center and includes correspondence with Norman Mailer, Bernard Malamud, James Baldwin and Elie Wiesel.



Founded in 1945 as a monthly journal of general interest from within the Jewish community, Commentary went through a dramatic shift in 1960 under its new editor, Norman Podhoretz, who applied more rigorous critical standards and made greater use of strong-minded New York intellectuals such as Irving Howe, Alfred Kazin and Mailer. The magazine responded to all the major controversies of the decade, from the Eichmann trial and the civil rights movement to the Vietnam War and the Columbia student uprising. 



Dickstein is Distinguished Professor of English and Theatre at the CUNY Graduate Center.

Strauss Center for International Security and Law presents ""Conquered into Liberty: The Deep Origins of the American Way of War"" with Eliot Cohen, professor of strategic studies at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS), Johns Hopkins University. Refreshments provided.



Why do Americans wage war the way they do? Some point to the Civil War and World War II as the seminal events in our military history; others see the frontier contest between Native Americans and settlers as the crucible of the American approach to war.  Professor Cohen offers another interpretation: that it emerged over a protracted struggle, both conventional and irregular, with the European masters of Canada, over a period of nearly two centuries, and that its focal point was the Great Warpath route between Albany and Montreal.



Cohen is the Robert E. Osgood Professor of Strategic Studies at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) of the Johns Hopkins University and founding director of the Philip Merrill Center for Strategic Studies.

Central to magazine work - online or in print - is the consideration of the pacing of images, texts and ideas. Structuring how information unfolds over time concerns many of those working in temporal media such as magazines, films or written narratives.



In each edition of this conversation series, one speaker is invited and prompted to request the company of a committed colleague, mentor or perhaps even a new acquaintance, creating a unique pairing for a dialogue.

"Natural products explored as probes of the pain pathway","25281@utexas.edu","The Lorene Morrow Kelley Distinguished Lecture Series welcomes David Julius, Ph.D., delivering his talk, ""From Peppers to Pit Vipers: Natural Products as Probes of the Pain Pathway.""



Julius is chair of the Department of Physiology at the University of California, San Francisco. His research focuses on the molecular biology of sensory transduction and neurotransmitter action in the mammalian nervous system. His goal is to understand the molecular basis of somatosensation - the process whereby we experience touch and temperature - with an emphasis on identifying molecules that detect noxious (pain-producing) stimuli. He is also interested in understanding how somatosensation is altered in response to tissue or nerve injury.



The Lorene Morrow Kelley Lectureship was established with gifts by Lorene Kelley Morrow to honor her sister, Marie Betzner Morrow, who at the time of her death in 1971 was an associate professor of microbiology at The University of Texas at Austin.","Applied Computational Engineering & Sciences Building (ACE), Avaya Auditorium 2.302","2013-05-06 16:00:00-05:00","2013-05-06 17:00:00-05:00","http://www.biosci.utexas.edu/news/2013/LoreneMorrowKelleyLecture.aspx"
